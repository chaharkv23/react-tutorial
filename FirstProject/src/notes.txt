Components:

-> Reusability
-> Separation of concerns
-> Don't repeat yourself
-> Don't do too many things in one and the same place(function)

    React allows you to create reusable and reactive components consisting of HTML and JavaScript(and CSS)
                                Declarative Approach
    Define the desired target state(s) and let react figure out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions.



    How components function are executed:
-> Components itself a function -> when jsx code executes, that components(function) display on output.
-> When we have to re-evaluate jsx code, we use state. Without state, there will be no updation on display.

    Working with State:
->  useState doesn't call inside any nested function but inside a component function.
-> state called for each element in other component.(independently) -> means if we change the value of one
   state, then it could not effect other element or couldn't change at that instance.
